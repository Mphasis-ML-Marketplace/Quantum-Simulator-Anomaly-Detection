# Quantum-Simulator-Anomaly-Detection
This solution is a quantum annealing based deep learning model capable of training on transactions data to identify anomalous transactions.


## Product overview

This solution is a quantum annealing-based deep learning approach to learn and understand the patterns in transactional data. It aims at learning the normal behavior patterns of the transactions during the training process using a generative pattern recognition algorithm. Once trained, the model can identify abnormal patterns of transactions, thereby classifying them as anomalous.

## Product Highlight 

* This solution can be used to identify transactions that are spurious given the transaction pattern of the customer. Identified spurious transactions can be flagged to the customer or blocked. This solution can be used by Banks, Credit Card Issuers, etc.

* This solution uses a semi-supervised approach-based generative deep learning model to learn normal transaction patterns using non-fraudulent data and then builds a 1-rule threshold model using data from both classes to identify the anomalous transactions using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The solution is also re-trainable to capture information drift.
